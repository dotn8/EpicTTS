# EpicTTS

EpicTTS is an open source software for all things text-to-speech. This software was developed because of glaring omissions from many free TTS programs. Some omissions include:

1. Lack of support for opening a text file via command line options (and thus, the impossibility of opening text files with the TTS program)
2. Lack of support for saving to a wave file.
3. Arbitrary, undocumented limitations on the length of the saved wave file.

Eventually, EpicTTS will solve all these problems. For now, it's a great way to do simple text-to-speech.
